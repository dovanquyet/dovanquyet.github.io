In this page, I will list some of my favorite quotes, mostly from films and TV series, that I incidentally heard and had impression. I may agree or disagree to each of them, with (kinda detailed) comments. These comments will somehow reflect my personalities and perspectives about life.

To be updated ...

### AI

"Learning about something is to learn its behavior, learn the way that it interacts with others in the environment."

I don't remember who said so, but the saying just poped up in my mind when I was thinking about the fundemental theory of AI.


### Raiden ([Mortal Kombat 11 Story](https://youtu.be/CdEi4lr4lMQ?t=12334))
"I thought that to control time and destiny fairly, I must purge myself of all human emotion... All that remained was pure logic. But I learned quickly that the logical choice is often not the just choice. Unless tempered by compassion and heart, logic leads to decisions no better than those based on anger or fear."

Comment: In the first two times I watched this story, I missed this part. But incidentally, when it's just few months from the moment I realized that I was over-aggressive to force someone to follow high-standard morality, the video came to me the third time, and I found what I should have been doing. People have freedom to choose their own path to maturity. At some periods, they need to be worse before becoming better versions of themselves. So, what I should do is, giving them **fair** (from both perspectives, and from the bottom of my heart) comments on what they are doing, rather than being dogmatic and forcing them to follow my path, my standard.

### Superman's mother ([Batman vs Superman (2016)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuQGFltywVQ))
"People hate what they don't understand. But they see what you do, and they (will) know who you are."

That really guides me what are the right things to do in social relationships. My responsibility is to reflect myself truly to others, so that my behaviors are consistent and others can easily and correctly understand me. I should not over-exaggerate my feelings/thoughts, nor do somethings weird just for fun. I need to be true to myself.
