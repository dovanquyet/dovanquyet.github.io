In this page, I will list some of my favorite quotes, mostly from films and TV series, that I incidentally heard and had impression. I may agree or disagree to each of them, with (kinda detailed) comments. These comments will somehow reflect my personalities and perspectives about life.

To be updated ...


### Raiden ([Mortal Kombat 11 Story](https://youtu.be/CdEi4lr4lMQ?t=12334))
"I thought that to control time and destiny fairly, I must purge myself of all human emotion... All that remained was pure logic. But I learned quickly that the logical choice is often not the just choice. Unless tempered by compassion and heart, logic leads to decisions no better than those based on anger or fear."

Comment: In the first two times I watched this story, I missed this part. But incidentally, when it's just few months from the moment I realized that I was over-aggressive to force someone to follow high-standard morality, the video came to me the third time, and I found what I should have been doing. People have freedom to choose their own path to maturity. At some periods, they need to be worse before becoming better versions of themselves. So, what I should do is, giving them **fair** (from both perspectives, and from the bottom of my heart) comments on what they are doing, rather than being dogmatic and forcing them to follow my path, my standard.
