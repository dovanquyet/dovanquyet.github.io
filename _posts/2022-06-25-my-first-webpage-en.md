Wow, I don't think that I can finish the first version of my web that fast, just within an afternoon.

It's pretty tricky that when we push code to github, it takes 5-10 mins to fully build the web. I didn't know that, I suppose there are some problem with my website, maybe some bugs that make the code not successfully built! But finally, it works!

P/s: No, I need to click to "pages build and deployment", the orange dot near the commit id. Then my repo will start to rebuild.
