Note: 'Avoidant' in this post means person who avoid to not have to do smt.

The experience in the group project I had in this semeseter is bad. Not just because of the trash paper we build our project on, but also the not-engaging attitude of my groupmates. If I wrote this post earlier, I must tell more stories to critize them stronger. But the following is enough.

I agreed that this group project has no benefit for all to invest time on. We all have our own research, our own interested topic, and that research is our main job as PG student. However, you should still view the group project as an one-off duty, e.g visit/hang out with your relatives that you don't know well or don't want to be with them, throwing trash, doing laundary, or urgent societal duty while your community is in need ... It is your duty, and not doing that will bring bad consequences. You may say that "Hmm, I let my teammate carry the team", but sorry, no one want to do that unless they benefit from that, like some peoples in government. I also don't want to do, but it is my responsibility to contribute to the project, thus I have done my job adequately. How about you? Avoidants? Except the last two days before the deadline, I always had to tell almost all of you what to do, and actually you 'waited' and didn't do it even though you are familiar with the topic and the code! Excuses? Sound like only I am not busy enough to do this project, right?

Yesterday we finished our presentation, thus finished the project. I treated you with no anger, because your unsatisfactory performance is in the past, not at present. Nonetheless, I hope that you (and also me) care more about others, the duty that you need to do with others. Don't run away, don't be a free rider!
