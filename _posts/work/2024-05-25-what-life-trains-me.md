## Beyond Technical Knowledge: Unexpected Skills We Have To Learn in a PhD in Computer Science

The world often views a PhD in Computer Science as a deep dive into algorithms and programming languages. While technical expertise is undeniably crucial, the reality is that a PhD program equips you with a surprisingly diverse set of skills that extend far beyond the realm of coding. In fact, you might be surprised to learn that your journey through a PhD program can train you in areas like journalism, public relations, and even customer service!

**1. Journalism: The Art of Asking the Right Questions**

Research is all about uncovering new knowledge, and at the heart of this process lies the ability to ask insightful questions. A PhD program hones your questioning skills, pushing you to challenge assumptions, probe deeper, and uncover hidden complexities. This relentless pursuit of understanding equips you with the critical thinking and questioning abilities that are essential for effective journalism. 

**2. Public Relations: Promoting Your Work and Building Your Brand**

In the academic world, effectively communicating your research findings is paramount. PhD programs provide numerous opportunities to present your work at conferences, write research papers, and engage with the broader scientific community. These experiences refine your communication skills, allowing you to articulate complex ideas clearly and persuasively. You learn how to tailor your message to different audiences, building your personal brand and promoting your research to the world.

**3. Customer Service: The Delicate Art of Peer Review**

The peer review process is an integral part of academic research, and it involves providing constructive feedback on the work of your colleagues. This experience teaches you the valuable skill of offering critical feedback to reviewer/customer's criticism in a way that is both helpful and respectful. You learn to identify strengths and weaknesses of your `product', engage in productive dialogue, and sympathize with criticism and ignorance of customers, all of which are essential qualities for providing excellent customer service.

And many more!

In conclusion, a PhD in Computer Science is much more than just coding. It's a transformative journey that equips you with a diverse set of skills, from communication and critical thinking to research and technical expertise. These skills empower you to excel not only in the field of computer science but also in various other aspects of your professional and personal life. So, if you're considering a PhD in Computer Science, be prepared to embark on an enriching journey that will shape you into a well-rounded individual with the potential to make a significant impact on the world.

## How about a research professor job?

Similar! Need team management skills, leadership, development strategy, etc. along with expertise. Thus, some professors who are good researchers may not be a good supervisor, as they lack of additional skills.

> Prompt: Write a short blog about the topic "a PhD in Computer Science program actually trains us in a lot of aspects beyond Computer Science, such as journalism (question others), PR (promote your works), customers service (peer review) along with research skills and technical knowledge"
