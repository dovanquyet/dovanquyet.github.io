title: 'An initiative to build a better search engine for NLP PhD application'
categories:

I am applying for an PhD program, and the most time-consuming step is collecting information of each professor and determining if his research interest match with my research interest. I think many students will share the same problem with me. Thus, after the PhD application period, I intend to call for collaboration to build such a database. Maybe we can apply NLP technique for better result, and write up an paper and submit to some conference.

I will detail my idea here, yet things will only start after Dec 25.
