- Value the help of friends (suggestions of schools, documents' review, application strategies). Recognize that I cannot do everything (well). We just don't have time to master everything

- Need to start soon, but I am not. A bit rush. Need a friend to push me

- Fee waiver :))

- Feel the heavy workload of filling application and finding professors with similar research directions. Think of supporting tools!
