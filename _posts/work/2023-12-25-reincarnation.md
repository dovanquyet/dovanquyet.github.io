> I will write up the whole post after the PhD application period

Key changes:
- Socialize more, and "seem to be a waste of time" occasions become very informative, even game changers, for me! -> enlighten me that I don't know many things and self-learning is not sufficient!
- No longer want to do PhD in Asia. Has to be the US. I want to go around, learn new things. I know that I don't know many many things. I am never that eager to learn from people around me!
- Dare to do things I never do/refuse to do before (like friends' posts before thinking, more active in social media :v). I remember someone said that Becoming a person you hate is a good way to complete yourself!



tiếp xúc với mn nhiều hơn
  đau mắt -> đi khám luôn, vì nếu ko đi thì sẽ lười ko bao giờ đi -> gặp 1 chị PG -> được tư vấn là nên đi Mỹ vì châu Âu giáo tôn trọng quyền tự do ~ ko quan tâm lắm! Ko ổn!

  check clip làm TA, thấy mình tăng động
  thì ra mình là 1 đứa trẻ nghịch ngợm, nhưng sợ bị người khác nhìn thấy
