> I will write up the whole post after the PhD application period

Key changes:
- Socialize more, and "seem to be a waste of time" occasions become very informative, even game changers, for me! -> enlighten me that I don't know many things and self-learning is not sufficient!
- No longer want to do PhD in Asia. Has to be the US. I want to go around, learn new things. I know that I don't know many many things. I am never that eager to learn from people around me!
- Dare to do things I never do/refuse to do before (like friends' posts before thinking, more active in social media :v). I remember someone said that Becoming a person you hate is a good way to complete yourself!
