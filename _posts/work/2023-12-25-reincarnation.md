I've been experiencing a refreshing change in my personality in the past three months, a shift that's opening my eyes to new possibilities and propelling me towards personal growth. It's like shedding an old skin and stepping into a brighter, more vibrant version of myself.

One of the most significant changes is my newfound love for socializing. Previously, I might have considered certain social gatherings as "a waste of time." However, I've realized that these interactions are actually treasure troves of information and unexpected opportunities.

For instance, a casual lunch with friends turned into a goldmine of advice about PhD applications and materials. Similarly, a visit to the clinic for an eye issue led to a chance encounter with a senior PhD friend who shared invaluable insights about supervision styles in the US and EU. These experiences have illuminated the vastness of knowledge that exists beyond my own self-learning efforts.

This newfound appreciation for social interaction has also fueled a burning desire to pursue my PhD in the US. I'm no longer content with the limitations of Asia. The US, with its diverse landscape and vibrant academic culture, beckons me to explore new horizons and expand my knowledge base. I'm eager to learn from the best minds in the field and immerse myself in a stimulating environment.

Another exciting change is my newfound boldness. I'm no longer afraid to do things I previously avoided, like actively engaging on social media. I've embraced the idea that stepping outside my comfort zone and trying new things, even those I might initially dislike, can lead to unexpected self-discovery. As someone once said, "Becoming a person you hate is a good way to complete yourself!"

Reflecting on my recent teaching assistant experience, I've realized that I'm actually quite energetic and a bit extroverted. Reviewing my session recordings revealed a surprising level of enthusiasm and dynamism in my teaching style. This newfound awareness has empowered me to embrace my natural personality and utilize it to connect with others and share my knowledge.

Overall, this period of transformation has been incredibly empowering. I'm embracing new experiences, expanding my horizons, and discovering hidden facets of myself. I'm excited to see where this journey will lead and what new opportunities await me as I continue to grow and evolve.

> Please help me to write a short blog about following key changes in my personality. It's like a refreshment of myself!\
\- Socialize more, and "seem to be a waste of time" occasions become very informative, even game changers, for me! -> enlighten me that I don't know many things and self-learning is not sufficient! E.g. have lunch with friends then get advice about PhD application and materials, or go to clinic when having eye ball's pain without hesitation then meet a senior PhD friend and get information about supervision style in EU and US.\
\- No longer want to do PhD in Asia. Has to be the US. I want to go around, learn new things. I know that I don't know many many things. I am never that eager to learn from people around me!\
\- Dare to do things I never do/refuse to do before (like friends' posts before thinking, more active in social media :v). I remember someone said that Becoming a person you hate is a good way to complete yourself!\
\- Recognize myself as energetic and a bit extrovert. Checking the record of my TA session and find out that I am kinda hyperative :))

> Gemini does a good job for this task, better than my expectation. Yet I gave it a pretty clear instruction, and that may be the key for a grounded generation.
