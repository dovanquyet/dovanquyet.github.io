To be updated ... Finally I want to update this post. It is one year since I created this post (2022-08-17). Now, it's time to complete it. Let's see, what I want to tell? Hmm, it is the story about choices, hesitance, and result at the end.

I used to have a relatively small shoulder, comparing to other people and other parts of my body. It made me look like a thin tree grown on a massive vase, as oppose to the shape "two sticks hold a potato". At the time, if I was able to choose my shoulder, that if we could exchange parts of our body freely in plug-and-play manner, of course I would take a shoulder that fits to my body. I did try to work out very hard for the whole summer, but the result was disappointing: my shoulder didn't become bigger so that my body became more musculine as I expected, my body even look thinner. Later I knew that I took the wrong exercise, but virtually I gradually lost my hope to build up my body by myself. It seems that only way for me is to take it from others.

At the beginning of this year, as I am suggested that working out with resistance band or weights (as external stimuli) will help my body break muscle and build a stronger one, I bought a set of resistance bands. I exercise with the bands 4-5 days a week, with all the workout sets focusing on chest, back, and shoulder muscles. After the workout, I can feel that my muscle (esp. my arm) become much larger (in Vietnamese, to hơn cái mặt), yet it turns back to the original state hours after the exercise. Personally I think there is not much grow in my body. Though I feel that my shirts become tighter, I am so sure to what extent it is true.

The moment that I came back to my home this summer is when the result is revealed. My mom, who is really obsessed about my 'abnormal' body acknowledged the grow of my body, especially my shoulder. She looked kinda happy about that, and I was happy too as my effort has paid me off.

So, what do I want to tell you? As I have no choice of my body, the only way for me to have a better body shape is staying calm and finding the solution for myself. On the other hand, if I have a choice, I will definite give up finding solution for my own, and go for the easier choice of taking parts I need from other people to have a better body shape. That is the strength of binding and responsibility. As long as the binding perserves and all the involved parties accepted the situation, it will gradually yield the desired result.

By the way, happy birthday to my body!

P/s. On this (special) day of last year, I found a senior comrade, who has been doing what I want to do in the future - Develop a society whose people live morally!
