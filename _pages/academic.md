Please take a look at my [Academic Resum√©](https://dovanquyet.github.io/files/DoVanQuyet_CV_full.pdf) (updated in May 2024), [Industrial 1-page CV](https://dovanquyet.github.io/files/DoVanQuyet_CV_1page.pdf) (updated in May 2024), and [my SoP](https://dovanquyet.github.io/files/SoP_Quyet_general.pdf) (which I consider as my predoctoral research statement). For full description of my academic and industrial experience and extracurricular activities, please visit my LinkedIn page.

### Independent Study

I have self-learned the following courses/series whose videos are available on Youtube, and also read some books. These are all amazing, and they significantly broaden my knowledge.

- Gregory L. Murphy - The Big Book of Concepts (reading)
- MIT - MIT 6.868J The Society of Mind, Fall 2011 (start, I need to learn the idea from Marvin Minsky because I believe that the idea will base the future NLP)
- Zero Knowledge Proofs - [MOOC Spring 23](https://zk-learning.org/) (interesting course, but not relevant to my current research. So ...). Another Block Chain [course](https://timroughgarden.github.io/fob21)
- Stanford - Human Behavioral Biology (not yet start)
- Wendy Wood - **Good Habits, Bad Habits** (finished in Sep 2023)
- Stanford - CS330 Deep Multi-Task and Meta Learning (finished Oct 2022)
- MIT - MIT 9.13 The Human Brain, Spring 2019 (finished in Sep 2022). Eventhough I only shallowly learned from this course, it really brings me the knowledge about our brain's functionality and inspires me a lot on how should I structure an AI system
- Harvard - **Justice: What's The Right Thing To Do** (finished in Jul 2022). This course gives me references to strengthen my reasoning system!
- Stanford - CS234 Reinforment Learning (finished in Jun 2022)
- Stanford - **CS224w Machine Learning on Graph** (finished in Feb 2022)
- PBS - The Vietnam War (finished in April 2020)
- Stanford - **CS224n Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning** (finished in Jun 2021)
