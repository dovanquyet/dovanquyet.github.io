## About me

Hi forks! Welcome to my personal homepage.
I'm an incoming M.Phil student at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), under the supervision of [Professor Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/). 
My research interest lies in the field of Natural Language Processing, Data Mining, etc. My dream is to apply NLP into real world, especially in education and psychological therapy.
