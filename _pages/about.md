## About me

Hi folks! Welcome to my personal homepage.
I'm a M.Phil student at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), under the supervision of [Professor Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/). 

My research interest lies in the field of Natural Language Processing, Data Mining, etc. My dream is to apply NLP into real world, especially in education and psychological therapy. Currently, I focus on how to incorporate commonsense knowledge in LMs, to make the models 'understand' (concepts) rather than just 'memorize' (word co-occurence).

About my personal life, I am a big fan of music. I consider myself as an amateur singer. Check this [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw0K4xQPwp8wZp6rkWRcTCg) to hear my voice :D Besides, about my spiritual, I am hugely inspired by the [Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh](https://plumvillage.org/thich-nhat-hanh/). His Buddhism originates the major portion of my reasoning system. My favorite book, not surprisingly, is one of his books, Old Path White Cloud ([en](https://terebess.hu/zen/mesterek/Thich%20Nhat%20Hanh%20-%20Old%20Path%20White%20Clouds.pdf),[vi](https://thuvienhoasen.org/images/file/3GfDvp1G0QgQAHtP/duong-xua-may-trang.pdf)).
